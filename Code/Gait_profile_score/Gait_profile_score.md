### The Gait Profile Score (GPS) and Movement Analysis Profile (MAP)

**_What is the Gait Profile Score?_**

The Gait Profile Score (GPS) is a summary measure of kinematic gait data<sup>1</sup>. It quantifies the deviation of a selection kinematic variables for an individual from a non impaired control population. The GPS is usually given as the overall score for both limbs, but separate scores for each limb can also be calculated. The Movement Analysis Profile (MAP) breaks down the GPS the give the contribution of each individual kinematic component. As they are derived from joint angles, all GPS and MAP values are in degrees. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) has been determined to be 1.6<sup>o</sup>, based on a correlation with an established clinical score (Functional Assessment Questionnaire, or FAQ)<sup>2</sup>. It has also been shown to have a strong relationship to clinical judgement among clinicians experienced in gait analysis<sup>3</sup>.

**_Which kinematic variables are used?_**

The variables were chosen on the basis of clinical importance and reliability.

Pelvic Tilt, Pelvic Obliquity, Pelvic Rotation
Hip Flexion, Hip Abduction
Knee Flexion
Ankle Dorsiflexion
Foot Progression

As there is only one pelvis segment, only the values from one side are used. Bilateral joint angles are used for all of the other variables. 

**_How is the GPS Calculated_**

The GPS is the root mean square (RMS) difference between an individuals kinematic data, for all of the above variables, and the mean data from a non impaired control group, across a gait cycle. The MAP for a given variable is simply the RMS difference between the joint angle for an individual and that of the control group across the gait cycle.
